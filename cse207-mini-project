# Student Record Management System

This project is a Java-based desktop application that manages student records using a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** as the core data structure.  
A **JavaFX graphical user interface (GUI)** is used to interact with the system.

The application allows users to create, search, delete, and view student records in a structured and organized manner.

## Application Features

### Insert Student Record
- Adds a new student record to the system  
- Each student is assigned a unique roll number  
- Records are stored in a Binary Search Tree  

### Search Student Record
- Searches for a student using the roll number  
- Efficient searching through BST traversal  

### Delete Student Record
- Deletes a student record using the roll number  
- Maintains BST structure after deletion  

### Show All Records
- Displays all student records  
- Records are shown in sorted order based on roll number  
- Implemented using in-order traversal of the BST

## Student Information Stored

Each student record includes:
- Student name  
- Roll number  
- Course enrolled  
- Total marks  
- CGPA  

---

## Implementation Details

- Student records are stored using a Binary Search Tree  
- Roll number is used as the unique key  
- BST operations (insert, search, delete, traversal) are implemented manually  
- The GUI interacts with the BST logic through a controller  
- Data is stored in memory during runtime  

---

## User Interface

- Built using JavaFX  
- Uses components such as:
  - TableView  
  - TextField  
  - Button  
- User actions are handled through a controller class  

---

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Java  
- GUI Framework: JavaFX  
- Data Structure: Binary Search Tree  
- Programming Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming
